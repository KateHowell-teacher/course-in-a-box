Course-in-a-Box is a free tool for building and publishing online courses—no prior coding experience required. This guide was made using Course-in-a-Box, so what you see here is what you’ll start with. There are three modules that walk through the course creation process, all linked in the nav bar at the top of the page:
* **[Setup](/modules/setup/getting-started/)** - Get your instance of Course-in-a-Box up and running
* **[Content](/modules/content/markdown-and-media)** -  Update the course structure and add your copy & media
* **[Customize](/modules/customize/favicon)** - Add some (optional) finishing touches

#### Made using Course-in-a-Box

P2PU created Course-in-a-Box in 2014 as a free and lightweight tool for building online courses. We wanted to preserve the modular structure of MOOCs outside of the bulky (and often proprietary) environment of learning/content management systems. Course-in-a-Box is open-source, and we welcome contributions [on our Github repo](https://github.com/p2pu/course-in-a-box).

p.s. Designing a course for learning circles? [Check out the Learning Circle Course Creation guide](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/116fJM3GS7XDzilUOL_ynMZ0yTncUD6aVUbcQKsTra6U/edit#heading=h.l36tzg40xcgr) for some best practices on course design.
